**Gameplay**: essentially, [Snake](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake). But this
time, instead of going straight, your snake travels on curves, and instead of being
inside a rectangular field, you are in a circular one.

**How to play**: press space or left mouse click to make your snake turn in the other
direction. If you lose, press R to restart the game

**Where to play**: well, [here](https://michelebucelli.github.io/csnake)
